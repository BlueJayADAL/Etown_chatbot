    "prompt": "What is a FYS", 
    "completion": "This interdisciplinary educational experience develops skills of critical thinking and writing and broadens definitions of learning. 
    The course is a serious academic one, and it is topical in nature, meaning that each seminar has its own emphasis. 
    Our faculty members teach seminars on subjects of passionate interest to them, but no seminar is grounded in a particular major. 
    Students in each seminar benefit from the support of a peer mentor—a sophomore, junior, or senior who works with the faculty to facilitate the transition from high school to college. 
    Over the course of the semester, peer mentors lead Roundtables devoted to navigation of campus electronic resources, discernment of Strengths, utilization of course registration software, and preparation for oral presentations. 
    Peer mentors thereby provide curricular and co-curricular foundations upon which students can rely both in the first year and beyond.
    Each seminar also includes out-of-class learning experiences, which will expose you to educational opportunities and cultural events on campus and, in many cases, beyond Elizabethtown as well. 
    In recent years, students have attended plays, lectures, art exhibits, and film screenings. 
    Some instructors have taken their students to museums in Philadelphia and Washington and even hiked the Appalachian Trail. 
    The possibilities are endless!As part of your orientation paperwork, you will select your top ten seminars from a list of approximately thirty courses.

{
    "prompt": "What is a First Year Seminar", 
    "completion": "This interdisciplinary educational experience develops skills of critical thinking and writing and broadens definitions of learning. 
    The course is a serious academic one, and it is topical in nature, meaning that each seminar has its own emphasis. 
    Our faculty members teach seminars on subjects of passionate interest to them, but no seminar is grounded in a particular major. 
    Students in each seminar benefit from the support of a peer mentor—a sophomore, junior, or senior who works with the faculty to facilitate the transition from high school to college. 
    Over the course of the semester, peer mentors lead Roundtables devoted to navigation of campus electronic resources, discernment of Strengths, utilization of course registration software, and preparation for oral presentations. 
    Peer mentors thereby provide curricular and co-curricular foundations upon which students can rely both in the first year and beyond.
    Each seminar also includes out-of-class learning experiences, which will expose you to educational opportunities and cultural events on campus and, in many cases, beyond Elizabethtown as well. 
    In recent years, students have attended plays, lectures, art exhibits, and film screenings. 
    Some instructors have taken their students to museums in Philadelphia and Washington and even hiked the Appalachian Trail.
